# Sapien AI

> **⚠️ Developer Preview**: This SDK is currently in beta and is subject to change. Use in production at your own risk.

An example of how to use the AI Elements to build Sapien AI.

## Setup

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your v0 API key:

```bash
# Get your API key from https://v0.dev/chat/settings/keys
V0_API_KEY=your_v0_api_key_here
```

## Getting Started

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

Sapien AI includes:

- **AI Elements Integration**: Uses AI Elements components for a polished UI
- **v0 SDK Integration**: Connects to the v0 Platform API for generating apps
- **Real-time Preview**: Split-screen interface with chat and preview panels
- **Conversation History**: Maintains chat history throughout the session
- **Suggestion System**: Provides helpful prompts to get users started

## Usage

1. Add your v0 API key to `.env.local`
2. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
3. Enter a prompt describing the app you want to build
4. Watch as v0 generates your app in real-time in the preview panel
5. Continue the conversation to iterate and improve your app

## Architecture

- `app/page.tsx` - Main UI with chat interface and preview panel
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - API route handling v0 SDK integration
- `components/ai-elements/` - AI Elements components for the UI

You now have a working Sapien AI base you can build off of! Feel free to explore the [v0 Platform API](https://v0.dev/docs/api/platform) and extend your app with additional features.
